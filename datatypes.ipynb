    "Data Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: Mutable data types can be changed after creation, while immutable data types cannot.\n",
    "    -   Example: Lists are mutable, and you can change their elements. Tuples are immutable; once created, you cannot change their elements.\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "2.  Explain the concept of dynamic typing in Python and how it differs from static typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: In Python, data types are determined at runtime (dynamic typing), unlike statically typed languages where data types are defined at compile time.\n",
    "    -   Example: You can assign different data types to a variable without declaring the type explicitly, e.g., `x = 5`, and later `x = \"Hello\"`.\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "3.  How do you determine the data type of a variable in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: You can use the `type()` function.\n",
    "    -   Example: `x = 42`, and then `type(x)` returns `<class 'int'>`.\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "4.  Explain the difference between \"is\" and \"==\" when comparing two variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: \"is\" checks if two variables reference the same object, while \"==\" checks if their values are equal.\n",
    "    -   Example: `a = [1, 2]`, `b = a`, `a is b` is True, and `a == b` is also True.\n",
    "   \n",
    "```python\n",
    "                x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "                y = x  # Both x and y reference the same list in memory i.e y = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "                z = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "                print(x is y)  # True, because x and y reference the same list\n",
    "                print(x is z)  # False, because x and z reference different lists\n",
    "                print(x == y)  # True, because x and y have the same content\n",
    "                print(x == z)  # False, because x and z have different content\n",
    " ```\n",
    "---\n",
    "5.  What is the purpose of the None data type in Python, and when is it typically used?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: `None` is used to represent the absence of a value or a null value, often used to initialize variables before assigning meaningful values.\n",
    "    -   Example: `result = None`.\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  How do you concatenate two strings in Python, and what are some alternatives to do so?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: You can use the `+` operator for concatenation. Other methods include `join()` and f-strings.\n",
    "    -   Example: `\"Hello, \" + \"World!\"` results in \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "7.  Explain the concept of string interpolation in Python and provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: String interpolation is embedding expressions within strings. In Python, you can use f-strings.\n",
    "    -   Example: `name = \"Alice\"; f\"Hello, {name}\"` results in \"Hello, Alice\".\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "8.  What is the difference between single-quoted and double-quoted strings in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: Single-quoted and double-quoted strings are functionally equivalent. Use one type to create a string, e.g., `'Hello'` or `\"World\"`.\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "9.  How can you check if a string contains a specific substring in Python, and what is the role of the \"in\" keyword?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Answer: Use the `in` keyword to check if a substring exists within a string.\n",
    "    -   Example: `\"world\" in \"Hello, World!\"` is True.\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "10.  What are escape characters in strings, and can you give examples of their usage?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Answer: Escape characters are used to include special characters in strings. Examples include \"\\n\" for a new line and \"\\t\" for a tab.\n",
    "---\n",
    "11.  Describe the difference between slicing and indexing strings in Python, and provide examples of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Answer: Indexing accesses individual characters, while slicing extracts a portion of a string.\n",
    "-   Example: `\"Hello\"[1]` returns \"e\", and `\"Hello\"[1:4]` returns \"ell\".\n",
    "---\n",
    "12.  What are some common string methods in Python, and when would you use methods like `split()`, `join()`, and `replace()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Answer: Common string methods include `split()`, `join()`, and `replace()`. `split()` is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter, `join()` is used to concatenate a list of strings, and `replace()` is used to replace a substring with another in a string.\n",
