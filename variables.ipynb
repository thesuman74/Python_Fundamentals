    "1. What is a variable in Python?\n",
    "- Answer: A variable in Python is a named container that stores data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do you assign a value to a variable in Python?\n",
    "- Answer: You assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator =. For example, x = 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain the rules for naming variables in Python.\n",
    "- Answer: Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. They are case-sensitive and shouldn't use reserved keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is variable casting in Python?\n",
    "- Answer: Variable casting is the process of converting a variable's data type to another type. For example, using str(), int(), or float().\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How can you assign values to multiple variables in one line in Python?\n",
    "- Answer: You can assign values to multiple variables in one line like this: ``` x, y, z = \"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\" ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the scope of a variable in Python?\n",
    "- Answer: Variables in Python can have local or global scope. Local variables are confined to a specific function, while global variables are accessible everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How do you print the value of a variable in Python?\n",
    "- Answer: You can print the value of a variable using the print() function. For example, print(x) will print the value of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is variable shadowing?\n",
    "- Answer: Variable shadowing occurs when a local variable has the same name as a global variable, potentially leading to confusion. Local variables take precedence over global variables within their scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain the concept of variable unpacking in Python.\n",
    "- Answer: Variable unpacking allows you to assign elements from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) to multiple variables in a single line. For example, a, b, c = (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why is it important to choose meaningful variable names in Python?\n",
    "- Answer: Meaningful variable names make your code more readable and maintainable. They convey the purpose of the variable and improve code comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are global variables, and how are they different from local variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global variables are defined outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the code. Local variables are declared within a specific function and can only be accessed within that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How can you access global variables within functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "To access global variables within functions, you can use the global keyword before the variable name. For example: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = \"global\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def myfunc():\n",
    "    global x\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Can you modify a global variable from within a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, you can modify a global variable from within a function by using the global keyword before the variable name to indicate that you intend to modify the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What are some best practices for naming variables in Python?\n",
    "- Best practices for naming variables include using descriptive and meaningful names, following naming conventions (e.g., using lowercase and underscores for variables), and avoiding single-letter or ambiguous names.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is a NameError in Python, and when does it occur with variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A NameError occurs in Python when a variable is used before it is defined. This error can occur if you try to access a variable that is out of scope or has not been declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. How does variable scope work inside loops, such as for and while loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables declared within a loop have local scope and are accessible only within that loop. They do not exist outside the loop unless explicitly defined globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is variable shadowing, and why should it be avoided?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable shadowing occurs when a local variable within a scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. It should be avoided because it can lead to confusion and unintended behavior."
